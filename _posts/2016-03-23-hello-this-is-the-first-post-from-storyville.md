Hello! This is the first post from Storyville.

For the last few months, we've been designing Storyville, a book app.

We see a future where your regular book reading app is a joy to open. Like reading from a good book. It's amazing how many years that's not been true.

We think choosing a book to fill your precious reading time is a broken process that's not often about high quality matching of what you would enjoy reading. There's also a massive hidden network of amazing writers struggling to connect their work with you. They aren't getting paid and these things together are kinda killing books as a thing we do for pleasure.

There's three of us working on this out of a secret dutch barge in London.  

Storyville makes finding an independent author, publisher an original, quirky favourite read as easy as finding your nearest best seller on Amazon or train station spin-shelf.

Happy reading!
